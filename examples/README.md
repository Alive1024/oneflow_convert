## oneflow_onnx samples

At present, oneflow2onnx supports the export of 80 + ONEFLOW OP to onnx Op. X2oneflow supports 79 onnx OP's, 50 + TensorFlow OP's, 80 + Pytorch OP's and 50 + PaddlePaddle OP's, covering most common operations of CV classification model. Note that the OP and model we support are all OP and model under the dynamic graph API, which requires that the version of PaddlePaddle > = 2.0.0, TensorFlow > = 2.0.0, and there is no explicit version requirement for Pytorch. At present, x2oneflow has successfully converted 50 + TensorFlow/Pytorch/PaddlePaddle official models. We provide all the test examples in the 'oneflow2onnx' and 'x2oneflow' folders respectively. If you want to export onnx or convert the custom TensorFlow/Pytorch/PaddlePaddle network, you can modify it accordingly.
